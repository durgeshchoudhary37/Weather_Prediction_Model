# Weather_Prediction_Model
Applied models like VGG16, ResNet101, MobileNet and DenseNet201 to classify the weather condition
Built the deep Neural Network using Tensorflow and tuned hyperparameters to obtain maximum accuracy of 83%
Processed the image dataset, performed EDA & classified it into 5 types using 3D Convolutional Layers in Keras
